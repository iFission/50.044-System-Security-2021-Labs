<!-- CSRF is not stopped by Single Origin Policy. This is so as SOP is a protection mechanism for the browser. Both CORS and SOP only prevents a page
     from rendering results from a server, and only a selective number of requests from the browser will undergo pre-flight requests where a request is 
     rejected at the browser/client level. In our case, the request is being sent via a URL encoded form through the POST method. This will hence not 
     require a pre-flight request, thus, the request is allowed to proceed. 
     We do note however that the response will not be rendered due to the SOP, but still, the request has successfully reached the backend server
     and applied, thus making our attack effective and successful.
